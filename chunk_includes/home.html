<h1 style="text-align: center;">Welcome!<br></h1>
<p> Dear Respondent,
<br>  
<p> Thank you for agreeing to participate in this research experiment. This study is part of a course project at Universit&agrave; degli Studi di Siena, regarding the interpretation of grammatical gender of nouns.</p>
<p> The experiment will last approximately<b> 10 minutes</b>, but you can proceed at your own pace. We would kindly appreciate your undistracted attention and ask you to follow all instructions carefully. You may not open other applications on your computer or engage in other distracting activities, such as using your cell phones or headphones etc.</p>

<p> Please, bear in mind that there are <b>no right or wrong answers to these questions</b>, what really matters is your opinion based on your language intuition.</p>

<p> We will start with a brief questionnaire to collect general information about you. <b>All answers are completely anonymous, confidential and gathered for the purpose of academic research only.</b> </p>
 
<p> Then, you will be given the instructions with a complete description of the experiment that will be followed by the real experiment. </p>


<p><b>We are grateful for your help!</b></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
