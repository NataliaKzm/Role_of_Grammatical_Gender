<p> Please, read the text carefully and follow the instructions provided.</p>


<p> We have an idea for a cartoon in which some characters are animals and objects we use in our everyday life. You will see a series of images depicting our "actors". We would like to ask you some questions about them. Your opinion will help us a lot to design our characters. There are no right or wrong answers, it is just a matter of feeling.</p>  

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/74/ce/b6/74ceb63596d0c0674f075128fbe92e02.jpg" style="width: 200; height: 150px;" /></p>

<p><tr>
  <td><strong>This character can speak, and we need to give it an appropriate voice. Decide what type of voice it should speak in - a male voice, or a female voice. Indicate your choice by selecting the letter "M" (if you choose a male voice) or "F" (if you choose a female voice).</strong></td></p>
  <p style="text-align: center;"><td><input class="obligatory" name="squirrel" type="radio" value="male" class="obligatory" id="csexmale" /><label for="csexmale"><strong>M</strong> </label>
  <input class="obligatory" name="squirrel" type="radio" value="female" id="csexfemale"/><label for="csexfemale"><strong> F</strong></label>
