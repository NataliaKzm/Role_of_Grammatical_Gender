# The Role of Grammatical Gender on the Mental Representation 


## Abstract
Although a number of studies (Boroditsky et al., 2002) outlined that people’s mental representation of objects can be influenced by particular grammatical properties of a language they speak, this approach is still controversial and raises serious debates in a linguistic society. The aim of the current work is to replicate the previous experiment with a different set of languages (Italian and Russian) in order to investigate the role of grammatical gender on people’s perceptions of similarity between objects and people.
